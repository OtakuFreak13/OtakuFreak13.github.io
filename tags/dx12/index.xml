      <description>Large Game Project: Hell Loop Link to the game on GameJolt
Game project spanning a whole semester with 9 other students made in a custom DX12 engine some of the students had ready from another course.
Hell Loop is a rogue-like 3rd-person hack-and-slash game where you encounter waves of enemies. Between the waves you can buy upgrades in a shop.
My main responsibility was the upgrade system, the backend for the Shop and, since we had no technical artist, making the models we bought compatible with our animation system using Blender and Maya.</description>
