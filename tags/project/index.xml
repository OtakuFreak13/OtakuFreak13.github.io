      <description>Large Game Project: Hell Loop Link to the game on GameJolt
Game project spanning a whole semester with 9 other students made in a custom DX12 engine some of the students had ready from another course.
Hell Loop is a rogue-like 3rd-person hack-and-slash game where you encounter waves of enemies. Between the waves you can buy upgrades in a shop.
My main responsibility was the upgrade system, the backend for the Shop and, since we had no technical artist, making the models we bought compatible with our animation system using Blender and Maya.</description>

      <description>Small Game Project: KamiCarZe Link to the game
A smaller game project that took 3 months for me and 5 other students to complete. Made in one of the students OpenGL engine.
It is a 2 to 4-player local multiplayer game where you control vehicles and compete against your friends to be the last car standing.
I mainly dealt with the UI and menues as well as the scoring system.</description>

      <description>Unity 2D project for Game Pysics course A Unity 2D project made by me and another student for our game physics course. The project uses our own projectile and explosion/shockwave physics. The max power/velocity is mach 2.89 since that was the velocity of the shell used in the calculations we read and we have drag coefficents up to that velocity.
You control the tank with A and D to move, Q and E to angle the turret and W and S to increase/decrease the launch velocity of the projectile.</description>
